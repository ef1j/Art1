#Archival copies of Art1

The purpopse of this directory is to preserve original listings of the Art1 code.

- `art1.f` The unmodified Art1 source code by Richard Williams, 1968-1970. This version was typed from a scan provided by Richard Williams to Paul Frank. The date is obscured in the printout. The available routines are: print array (1), straight lines (2), solid rectangles (3), open rectangles (4), triangles (5), ellipses (6), quadrants (7), (exponential)\*(time) (8). Errors or bugs in the code have not been corrected.
- `art1_1968_11_05.f`COMING SOON. Presumably an early version of Art1. It has fewer routines. The listing is from Hammersley's papers at the Archives of American Art and is dated November 5, 1968. The available routines are: print array (1), straight lines (2), solid rectangles (3), open rectangles (4), triangles (5).
