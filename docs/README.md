Richard Williams' mimeographed notes were distributed to students and colleagues at the University of New Mexico. Katherine Nash traveled with a copy of the notes to the UK in 1969, which Jasia Reichardt transcribed for her book, The Computer in Art. (Frank, p. 106) Williams' original notes are reproduced here with permission of Williams' family in accordance with the license of this repository.
