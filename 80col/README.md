# Portrait mode Art1

`lart1.f` is a modified Art1 program for letter page output.

The modified Art1 arrays are 73 columns by 55 rows and print in portrait. This preserves the printed aspect ratio of Art1 (1.26) for 10 characters / inch horizontal and a vertical spacing of 6 rows / inch.

`test.25` is test input.
