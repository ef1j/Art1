# Portrait mode Art1

`lart1.f` is a modified Art1 program for letter page output.

The `lart1` arrays are 73 columns by 55 rows and print in portrait. This preserves the printed aspect ratio of Art1 (1.26) for 10 characters / inch horizontal and a vertical spacing of 6 rows / inch.

`test.25` is test input.

72 column Art1 output for teleprinters such as the ASR-33 are left as an excercise to the reader.
