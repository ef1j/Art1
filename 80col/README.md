# Portrait mode Art1

`lart1.f` is a modified Art1 program for letter page output.

The `lart1` arrays are 73 columns by 55 rows and print in portrait. These dimensions create small margins and preserve the printed aspect ratio of the orignial Art1 -- 1.26 for 10 characters / inch horizontal and a vertical spacing of 6 rows / inch.

`test.25` is test input.

Use [Olivettize](https://github.com/ef1j/Olivettize) to create a PDF of simulated output from an Olivetti Te-318 teleprinter.

72 column Art1 output for teleprinters, such as the ASR-33, is left as an exercise for the reader.
